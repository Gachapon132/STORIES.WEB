Only then will the trees part to show you the path home."

Its feathers are made of liquid flame, and its song can heal any wound.\n\nAs it passes over the mountains, the snow melts into boiling rivers.

It is the most honest library in existence.\n\nScholars come from all over to study the 'Rainy Day' section, which is filled with the most moving poetry ever composed."

        content: `Once upon a time, there was a young man named Lucas who lived with his elderly mother in a small village. Lucas’s mother was kind and hardworking, having spent her whole life making sure Lucas had everything he needed.

The Change in Heart
As Lucas grew older and stronger, he began to change. He became arrogant and started hanging out with a crowd that valued wealth and status over family. He began to see his mother—who was now frail, wrinkled, and dressed in old clothes—as an embarrassment.

Whenever his friends would come over, Lucas would hide his mother in the kitchen or tell her to stay in the back room so no one would see her.

The Confrontation
One evening, just as the sun was setting (the time of Orasyon or Angelus), Lucas was hosting a party for his wealthy friends. His mother, feeling weak and hungry, stumbled into the living room to ask for a bit of water.

Instead of helping her, Lucas became furious. He yelled at her in front of everyone, saying:

"Why are you showing your face here? You are old, ugly, and you smell of the earth! Get down on the ground where you belong!"

He pushed his mother so hard that she fell to the floor. Heartbroken and weeping, the mother looked up at her son and said, "If you are so ashamed of me that you want me on the ground, then perhaps you should stay there yourself."

The Transformation
Suddenly, the sky darkened, and a loud crack of thunder echoed through the house. Lucas began to shrink. His skin turned scaly and mottled, his limbs grew short and thin, and his voice turned into a faint "tiki-tiki-tiki" sound.

He tried to call out to his friends, but he was now a small creature scurrying across the floor. Out of shame, he ran up the wall to hide in the shadows.

The Moral and the "Orasyon"
To this day, Filipinos observe the behavior of the butiki (house lizard). People say that:

The Kiss: Every evening during the Orasyon (twilight), the lizard descends from the wall to "kiss" the ground. This is said to be Lucas, still performing an eternal act of penance, asking for his mother’s forgiveness for his arrogance.

The Sound: Its unique chirping sound is a reminder of the voice Lucas lost when he chose to be cruel.

Note: This legend is often used by Filipino parents to teach children the importance of Pagmamano (respecting elders) and the consequences of being "ingrato" (ungrateful).`
